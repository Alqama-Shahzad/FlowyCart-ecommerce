# Screenshot Instructions

To complete the README.md file with your own screenshots, follow these steps:

1. Run your project locally using `npm run dev`
2. Take screenshots of the following pages:
   - Landing Page
   - Collections Page
   - Product Details Page
   - Cart Modal
   - Shopping Bag Page

3. Upload these screenshots to an image hosting service like Imgur.com

4. Replace the placeholder image URLs in README.md with your actual image URLs:
   - Replace `https://i.imgur.com/XYZ123.png` with your Landing Page screenshot URL
   - Replace `https://i.imgur.com/XYZ124.png` with your Collections screenshot URL
   - Replace `https://i.imgur.com/XYZ125.png` with your Product Details screenshot URL
   - Replace `https://i.imgur.com/XYZ126.png` with your Cart Modal screenshot URL
   - Replace `https://i.imgur.com/XYZ127.png` with your Shopping Bag screenshot URL

5. Commit and push the updated README.md to your GitHub repository

This will ensure the README.md displays your own screenshots instead of placeholder images.
